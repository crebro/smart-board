# Smart Board

Smart Board (hopefully in the future) tries to recognize whatever you draw with your mouse!
it can be letters in maths, text and any sort of shapes in the future

## What is being used / what could be (used / done) in the future

Currently p5.js is being used to draw things on the whiteboard, sessions could be saved in the future,
and people could be able to share their whiteboard with others etc.

## CheckList

- [ ] Recognizing text
- [ ] Colors and beautification
- [ ] Shapes recognition
- [ ] Sharing / viewing as students (hopefully in the future)
